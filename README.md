# üñºÔ∏è Image Processing with Python (Colab)

This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using Python's PIL library and the `rembg` background removal tool in a Google Colab environment.

## üîß Features

The script provides the following image processing functionalities:

1. **Image Smoothing**
   - Applies a smoothing filter to an uploaded image.
   - Saves and displays the result.

2. **Image Rotation**
   - Rotates the uploaded image by 90 degrees (configurable).
   - Saves and displays the rotated image.

3. **Grayscale Conversion**
   - Converts the uploaded image to grayscale.
   - Saves and displays the output.

4. **Image Resizing**
   - Resizes the uploaded image to 300x300 pixels.
   - Saves and displays the resized image.

5. **Background Removal & Replacement**
   - Removes the background from the uploaded image using `rembg`.
   - Replaces it with a solid blue background.
   - Saves and displays the composited image.

## üìÇ How to Use

1. Clone the repository or open the original [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ThUlhsiAGe2YSptta4vlgh2M5iSwQR5t).
2. Upload an image when prompted in each cell.
3. Observe the transformations and save the results as needed.
